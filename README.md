## About me :butterfly: :computer: :deer: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :microscope: :seal: :telescope:
I am a Lecturer and Researcher in Animal Behaviour, Conservation and Freshwater Biology at [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/) (ATU). I am joint coordinator of the [MSc in Conservation Behaviour](https://www.atu.ie/courses/master-of-science-conservation-behaviour) at ATU. My main research interests are animal contest behaviour, animal communication, and the application of behavioural concepts to wildlife management and conservation. I am also interested in the ecology of freshwater species, the ecology and conservation of Irish butterflies, and methodological and statistical techniques used in ecological research. You can find a list of my publications [here](martingammell/publications/README.md).
