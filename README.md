## Background
I am a Lecturer and Researcher in Animal Behaviour, Conservation and Freshwater Biology at <a href="http://www.atu.ie">Atlantic Technological University (ATU)</a>. I am joint coordinator of the MSc in Conservation Behaviour at ATU. My main areas of research are animal contest behaviour, social dominance, animal communication and, more generally, the application of behavioural concepts to wildlife management and conservation. I am also interested in the ecology of freshwater species, the conservation of Irish butterflies, and in methodological and statistical techniques used in ecological research.
